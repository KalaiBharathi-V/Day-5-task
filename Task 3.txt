Read about the  difference between window, screen and document in JavaScript

In JavaScript, the terms "window," "screen," and "document" are used to refer to different objects and concepts related to web development. Each of these objects has distinct properties and purposes:

Window:

The window object represents the browser window or tab that contains the web page.
It is the top-level object in the browser's object model and serves as the global object in the browser's JavaScript environment.
You can access the window object globally in your JavaScript code without explicitly referencing it.
For example, you can use alert('Hello, World!') without specifying window.alert('Hello, World!').
The window object provides access to various properties and methods related to the browser window,
such as window.innerWidth to get the viewport width, window.location to interact with the current URL,
and window.open() to open new browser windows or tabs.

Screen:

The screen object represents the user's screen or monitor.
It provides information about the screen's dimensions and properties.
You can access properties like screen.width and screen.height to get the screen's resolution in pixels, 
screen.availWidth and screen.availHeight to get the available screen space (excluding the taskbar or other system elements), 
and screen.colorDepth to get the color depth of the screen.
The screen object is useful when you want to design web pages or applications that adapt to different screen sizes and resolutions.

Document:

The document object represents the HTML document currently loaded in the browser window.
It provides access to the structure and content of the web page.
You can use the document object to manipulate and interact with the DOM (Document Object Model),
which represents the hierarchy of HTML elements on the page.
For example, you can access elements using document.getElementById('elementId'), modify their content with element.innerHTML, 
or add event listeners to handle user interactions.
The document object also provides access to various properties and methods for managing the web page, 
such as document.title to set or retrieve the page title, document.
URL to get the current URL, and document.cookie to work with cookies.
In summary, "window" represents the browser window or tab, "screen" represents the user's screen properties, and "document" 
represents the currently loaded HTML document.
These objects are crucial for building interactive web applications and provide various methods and properties to interact with and manipulate web content.
